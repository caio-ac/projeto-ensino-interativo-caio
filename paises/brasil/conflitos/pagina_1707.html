                  <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                    A Guerra dos Emboabas (1707-1709) foi um conflito no Brasil Colônia pela posse das minas de ouro
                    em Minas Gerais, envolvendo os paulistas (descobridores e bandeirantes) que queriam exclusividade
                    e os emboabas (forasteiros de Portugal e outras regiões), que desafiaram esse direito, resultando
                    na vitória dos emboabas e na derrota dos paulistas, que foram forçados a buscar novas minas em
                    Goiás e Mato Grosso, enquanto a Coroa Portuguesa interveio para controlar a região.

                    Com a notícia da descoberta de ouro no sertão do Brasil, inúmeras pessoas migraram para a região
                    das minas em busca da riqueza por meio da exploração do metal precioso. Aqueles que chegaram
                    posteriormente foram chamados pejorativamente de emboabas, um termo indígena que significa
                    “estrangeiros”, “forasteiros”. Não tardou para que paulistas e emboabas entrassem em conflito,
                    disputando a exploração das minas de ouro. Os emboabas, pouco antes da guerra, mataram dois chefes
                    paulistas que tentaram impor o domínio dos bandeirantes e nomearam Manuel Nunes Viana como
                    governador da região das minas. Dessa forma, os estrangeiros estavam destinados a expulsar os
                    paulistas e obter o domínio da exploração aurífera.
                  </p> <br>
                  <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                    Os paulistas e os emboabas se confrontaram entre 1708 e 1709. Manuel Nunes Viana liderou as tropas
                    emboabas enquanto Borba Gato chefiou os bandeirantes na guerra. Em Campo da Traição, próximo da
                    atual cidade mineira de Tiradentes, aconteceu a batalha mais trágica e que definiu a vitória dos
                    emboabas. Com a expulsão dos paulistas, os estrangeiros tiveram o domínio das minas.
                  </p> <br>
                  <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                    Com a derrota dos paulistas, as minas ficaram sob o domínio dos estrangeiros, o que impulsionou a
                    ida de novas expedições para a região, vindas de várias partes do Brasil e de Portugal. Os
                    paulistas foram expulsos da região, mas não desistiram da exploração aurífera e migraram para
                    Goiás e Mato Grosso, descobrindo novas minas de ouro, instalando-se na região e fundando novas
                    vilas, como Vila Boa e Pirenópolis. A economia brasileira se diversificou com o surgimento do
                    comércio interno, que atendia a população que trabalhava nas minas.

            description2: "O confronto opôs, de um lado, os bandeirantes — responsáveis pelas primeiras descobertas auríferas e que, por isso, reivindicavam prioridade ou exclusividade na exploração — e, de outro, um grupo heterogêneo de forasteiros vindos de outras capitanias e do reino. A maioria desses mineradores era da região nordeste, onde a presença portuguesa era maior. Contudo, aquela região era parte da Capitania de São Vicente, dominada pelos bandeirantes paulistas, os quais não desejavam dividir o ouro.",
            description3: "Além disso, os comerciantes desejavam o monopólio do comércio de gêneros para o abastecimento dos arraiais, com destaque para o fornecimento de animais para o abate e o consumo. Portanto, o monopólio na exploração das minas de ouro, bem como na comercialização de gêneros de primeira ordem, foram as principais causas do conflito.",
            description4: "A Guerra dos Emboabas consolidou-se como um dos primeiros grandes conflitos internos do Brasil, evidenciando tensões entre diferentes grupos de colonos e inaugurando um padrão de disputas em torno do controle das riquezas minerais recém-descobertas. ",
            additionalInfo: "O conflito aparece representado em obras literárias, televisivas e historiográficas que exploram a formação das Minas Gerais e as tensões coloniais. A narrativa ficcional mais conhecida é o romance A Muralha (1954), de Diná Silveira de Queirós, que dramatiza a expansão bandeirante e a violência dos confrontos entre paulistas e forasteiros no contexto da descoberta do ouro.",
