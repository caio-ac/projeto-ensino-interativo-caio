                    <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                      A Insurreição Pernambucana, também conhecida como Guerra da Luz Divina, foi um conflito que ocorreu entre 1645 e 1654 no Nordeste brasileiro, principalmente na capitania de Pernambuco. O conflito envolveu colonos portugueses e holandeses, e teve como ponto de partida a Restauração Portuguesa em 1640, que fez com que Portugal recuperasse sua autonomia política. A insurreição foi motivada por questões econômicas, políticas e religiosas, e resultou na expulsão dos holandeses do território brasileiro.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                      Até 1644, a colonização holandesa em Pernambuco foi gerida por José Maurício de Nassau, fornecendo empréstimos aos senhores de engenho. Com a sua demissão, as cobranças se tornaram abusivas, o que provocou indignação entre os luso-brasileiros. Além disso, outro fator que levou ao estopim dos conflitos foi a perseguição religiosa aos católicos. A Holanda era um país calvinista. No contexto das reformas religiosas, isso significou uma rivalidade com Portugal e os luso-brasileiros da colônia, por conta da forte aliança dos portugueses com a Igreja Católica.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                      A insurreição começou em 1645, quando os luso-brasileiros se revoltaram contra o domínio holandês. A guerra foi marcada por batalhas sangrentas, como a Batalha dos Guararapes, que ocorreu em 1648 e 1649, onde as forças luso-brasileiras conseguiram derrotar os holandeses. A insurreição culminou com a assinatura do Tratado de Haia em 1661, que reconheceu a soberania portuguesa sobre o Brasil e encerrou oficialmente o domínio holandês na região.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                      A Insurreição Pernambucana teve um impacto significativo na história do Brasil. Ela fortaleceu a identidade nacional brasileira e contribuiu para a consolidação do domínio português sobre o território. Além disso, a insurreição também teve repercussões na Europa, influenciando as relações entre Portugal e os Países Baixos. A insurreição é lembrada como um símbolo de resistência e luta pela liberdade no Brasil colonial.

            description: "A Insurreição Pernambucana, chamada pelos portugueses de Guerra da Luz Divina, foi um conflito travado entre colonos portugueses e holandeses, entre os anos de 1645 e 1654. Esse conflito foi travado no Nordeste brasileiro, principalmente na capitania de Pernambuco, que sediava o domínio holandês no Brasil.",
            description2: "A Restauração Portuguesa, em 1640, é entendida como o ponto de partida para a Insurreição Pernambucana, uma vez que fez com que Portugal recuperasse a autonomia política que havia sido perdida em 1580. Com isso, fortalecia-se a ideia de recuperar os territórios que pertenciam a Portugal antes da União Ibérica. O Nordeste era um deles. Além disso, a administração holandesa no Nordeste estava em decadência e sofrendo com escassez de alimentos e queda no preço do açúcar. A situação se agravou quando a Companhia das Índias Ocidentais demitiu Nassau de sua posição, ordenando o seu retorno para a Europa.",
            description3: "Os mais conhecidos líderes que conduziram as tropas dos colonos portugueses na luta contra os holandeses foram André Vidal de Negreiros, João Fernandes Vieira, Henrique Dias e Filipe Camarão. Eles tiveram notório papel em batalhas importantes da insurreição.",
            description4: "E por falar em batalhas, os dois grandes destaques são as duas Batalhas de Guararapes. A primeira Batalha dos Guararapes aconteceu em 19 de abril de 1648, com as tropas lusas sendo lideradas pelos nomes já mencionados. Diz-se que um ataque luso contra a retaguarda holandesa foi o motivo para a derrota holandesa, resultando em mais de 500 mortes do lado holandês. E a segunda batalha foi travada em 16 de fevereiro de 1649, resultando em mais uma derrota holandesa. Essa segunda derrota fez com que os holandeses se isolassem em Recife para se proteger dos ataques dos colonos.",

            additionalInfo: "Os principais líderes da resistência portuguesa receberam um código postal com seus nomes em 1954, no tricentenário da insurreição. André Vidal de Negreiros, João Fernandes Vieira, Filipe Camarão e Henrique Dias foram homenageados por sua contribuição para a vitória portuguesa contra os holandeses.",
