                  <p>
                    Ela <strong>marcou o fim do regime militar</strong> que governou o país de 1964 a 1985,
                    estabelecendo um sistema democrático e garantindo uma série de direitos civis, políticos e sociais
                    aos cidadãos brasileiros.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A Constituição de 1988 é conhecida por sua ênfase na proteção dos <strong>direitos humanos,

O regime de exceção, em que as garantias individuais e sociais eram restritas, ou mesmo ignoradas, e cuja finalidade era garantir os interesses da ditadura, internalizados em conceitos como segurança nacional, restrição das garantias fundamentais, torturou e executou opositores. Durante o processo de abertura política, em 1984, o país foi varrido pelo que ficou conhecido como Diretas Já, isto é, a exigência popular de que o presidente brasileiro que seria eleito em 1985 viesse de eleição direta, ou seja, com participação popular. Anseio que se tornou necessidade após o fim da ditadura militar e a redemocratização do Brasil, a partir de 1985.",
