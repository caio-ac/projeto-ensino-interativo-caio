                <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">Resumo do Brasil Holandês</h6>
                <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                  A invasão do Nordeste brasileiro pelos holandeses resultou diretamente das relações diplomáticas entre
                  Portugal, Espanha e Holanda no final do século XVI. Até 1580, a Holanda tinha um envolvimento direto
                  com o negócio do açúcar produzido no Brasil, pois foram eles que financiaram o desenvolvimento do
                  negócio aqui e eles também participavam do refino e da comercialização do açúcar na Europa. Com a
                  união das coroas de Portugal e Espanha em 1580, a Holanda, que estava em guerra com a Espanha, passou
                  a ser inimiga de Portugal também.
                </p> <br>
                <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                  A Companhia Holandesa das Índias Ocidentais (WIC) foi criada em 1621 para explorar as colônias
                  espanholas e portuguesas nas Américas e na África. Em 1630, uma esquadra holandesa comandada por
                  Hendrick Lonck invadiu Pernambuco. Os holandeses, sob o comando da WIC, conquistaram a capitania de
                  Pernambuco, onde, em fevereiro de 1630, conquistaram Olinda e depois Recife. Com a vitória, os
                  invasores foram reforçados por um efetivo de mais seis mil homens, enviado da Europa para assegurar a
                  posse da conquista.
                </p> <br>
                <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                  Entre 1630 e 1637, os holandeses estenderam o seu domínio pelo Nordeste brasileiro e conquistaram
                  regiões como a Paraíba e o Rio Grande do Norte. A partir de 1637, foi enviado pela WIC o alemão
                  Maurício de Nassau para administrar a colônia holandesa. Ele era um militar e foi indicado para
                  assumir o cargo e aqui permaneceu até 1643. A administração de Nassau foi um momento importante para o
                  estabelecimento dos holandeses no Brasil. Maurício de Nassau realizou inúmeras ações para o
                  desenvolvimento da colônia. Ele procurou recuperar a economia açucareira de Pernambuco ao vender
                  engenhos que tinham sido abandonados durante a guerra entre portugueses e holandeses e procurou
                  estabelecer algumas normas para a melhoria da vida, como a obrigatoriedade de se plantar mandioca,
                  proibição de se jogar lixo nas ruas, entre outras medidas.
                </p> <br>
                <p class="font-weight-bold text-secondary">
                  A decadência da colônia holandesa pode ser explicada por alguns fatores. Primeiramente, houve a
                  falência da Companhia das Índias Ocidentais, o que acabou prejudicando severamente o empreendimento,
                  uma vez que eles eram os responsáveis. Nessa questão, podemos destacar também a demissão de Maurício
                  de Nassau de sua função de governador-geral da colônia. Além disso, houve a Restauração de Portugal
                  que ocorreu quando Portugal readquiriu sua independência, e seu trono passou a ser ocupado por d. João
                  IV, inaugurando a dinastia dos Bragança. Com esse acontecimento, os portugueses deram início a
                  esforços para recuperar sua colônia e passaram a incentivar os colonos para que os holandeses fossem
                  expulsos do Nordeste.
