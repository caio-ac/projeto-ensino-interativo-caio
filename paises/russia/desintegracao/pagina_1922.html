          description: `Em 1922, a Rússia Soviética, sob o controle do Partido Bolchevique liderado por Vladimir Lênin, consolidava o poder após a Guerra Civil Russa (1917-1922). O fim das hostilidades internas permitiu a criação da União das Repúblicas Socialistas Soviéticas (URSS) em dezembro de 1922, unindo a Rússia com outras repúblicas soviéticas, como Ucrânia, Bielorrússia e Transcaucásia.`,
          description2: `Em 1922, a economia russa enfrentava grandes dificuldades após a guerra civil, com inflação alta, escassez de produtos e uma agricultura devastada. A indústria estava paralisada, e a infraestrutura comprometida. O governo bolchevique tentava estabilizar a situação, controlando a distribuição de alimentos e bens essenciais, enquanto as tensões sociais aumentavam, especialmente entre os camponeses.`,
          additionalInfo: `No cenário internacional, a Rússia Soviética enfrentava o isolamento diplomático. Tentativas de ganhar reconhecimento, como na Conferência de Gênova (1922), falharam em garantir alianças duradouras com as potências ocidentais. A crescente desconfiança da Europa em relação à "ameaça bolchevique" consolidou a política de autossuficiência da Rússia e intensificou sua busca por alianças regionais, incluindo acordos com a Turquia de Mustafa Kemal e tentativas de influenciar movimentos socialistas internacionais.`,
