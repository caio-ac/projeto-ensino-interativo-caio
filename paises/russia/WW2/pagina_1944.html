        description: "Em 1944, a União Soviética entrou na fase ofensiva total da guerra no Front Oriental, reconquistando vastas áreas ocupadas e levando o conflito diretamente ao território das potências do Eixo. O ano foi marcado por operações militares maciças e pela libertação de países do Leste Europeu.",
        description2: "Um dos destaques do ano foi a Operação Bagration, lançada em junho de 1944, que destruiu o Grupo de Exércitos Centro da Wehrmacht. Essa operação resultou na liberação da Bielorrússia e na devastação das forças alemãs, abrindo caminho para avanços profundos em direção à Polônia.",
        description3: "Ao longo do ano, as forças soviéticas também libertaram a Ucrânia, os Estados Bálticos e partes da Romênia e Hungria. A entrada do Exército Vermelho nesses países teve implicações políticas profundas, com a instalação de regimes pró-soviéticos em territórios liberados.",
        description4: "Internamente, a mobilização econômica e militar continuava em ritmo acelerado. Apesar das pesadas perdas sofridas em anos anteriores, a produção de armamentos soviéticos atingiu seu auge, sustentando as ofensivas de larga escala.",
        additionalInfo: "Em 1944, a União Soviética consolidou seu papel como potência decisiva na guerra. As vitórias militares colocaram o Exército Vermelho às portas da Alemanha, enquanto Stalin começou a moldar a esfera de influência soviética na Europa Oriental, preparando o terreno para a Guerra Fria.",
